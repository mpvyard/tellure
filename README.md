# Time-Series Processor (TSProcessor)

## About

This is root folder of project, which contains entry points to different projects and their settings.

The main purpouse of project is enabling generation, clusterisation, classification and other different kinds of processing time series.

## Consist of:

- Tellure.Generator - project responsible for generating different kinds of time series (now only Lorentz time series are supported)
- Riowil.Algorithms - project that is woring with time series and responsible for clusterization (by Wishart algorithm for example) and other types of time series processing (including "painting")
- TSProcessor - app for working with libs.

The document is not ready yet, the same applies to app itself. So the project status is just work in progress and we believe in its succesfull finishing in short time :)
